# ReactJS and Tailwind CSS Assignment

This repository showcases an assignment I developed using ReactJS and Tailwind CSS. The focus of this project was to create an interactive and efficient interface for managing ideas within an infinitely long list.

## Key Features

- **Seamless Addition:** Users can effortlessly add new items to the list using keyboard shortcuts or the dedicated 'Add Idea' button.
- **Autocomplete Functionality:** A unique aspect of this implementation is the ability to autocomplete ideas by utilizing double angle brackets (`<< >>`). When users type `<<`, a dropdown displays suggestions for referencing existing ideas.
- **Connectivity:** Each idea can be linked to another by referencing it using the aforementioned autocomplete feature. The linking mechanism ensures a seamless connection between ideas.
- **Dynamic Deletion:** Enhancing user experience, pressing the backspace key selects and deletes the entire reference, just like the behavior of hashtags in certain applications.
- **Utilizing ProseMirror:** The editor used in this project, ProseMirror, guarantees a robust editing experience, offering flexibility and real-time rendering of content changes.

## Front-End Focus

This front-end application, although not integrated with a back-end, fully demonstrates the desired functionality. It does not require persistence through a back-end system. The main components include:

- **Adding Ideas:** Users can promptly add new ideas to the list.
- **Referencing Ideas:** The ability to reference other ideas using double angle brackets ensures an intuitive and efficient user experience.

While this project does not encompass the back-references section, it excels in delivering a unidirectional linking system that autocompletes and references ideas, enhancing the management of thoughts and concepts.
